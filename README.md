# ALGOS-FOR-COMPUTING-THE-LOWER-AND-UPPER-BOUNDS-OF-THE-PACKING-NUMBER-OF-3-TOKEN-GRAPH-OF-PATH-GRAPH.

This work only needs three files, which are to be run on python, Wolfram Mathematica and c++.

## Libraries needed for the python file

## The python file
Once you have your libraries correctly installed, you just have to run the python file.

The second you run it, the program will ask which Pn and F3Pn files do you want to generate? You just have to enter the n as a number and hit enter (e.g. 12)
