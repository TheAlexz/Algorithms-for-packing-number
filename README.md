# ALGOS-FOR-COMPUTING-THE-LOWER-AND-UPPER-BOUNDS-OF-THE-PACKING-NUMBER-OF-3-TOKEN-GRAPH-OF-PATH-GRAPH.

This work only needs three files, which are to be run on python, Wolfram Mathematica and c++.

## Libraries needed for the python file

## The python file
Once you have your libraries correctly installed, you just have to run the python file.

The second you run it, the program will ask which Pn and F3Pn files do you want to generate? You just have to enter the n as a number and hit enter (e.g. 12)

Then, once you run it, the program will generate the Pn, Pn^2, F3(Pn) and F3^2(Pn) graphs automatically and then store them both in a .gml and .html files

When the program is finished, you should see 8 files in the same folder as your python file, that is, the Pn, Pn^2, F3(Pn) and F3^2(Pn) both in .gml and .html files

You can open any html file on any web browser and you should see that graph on your window, you are free to move each node with your cursor in a dynamic way
